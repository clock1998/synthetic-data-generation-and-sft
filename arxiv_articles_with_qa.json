        "question": "What is the focus of the research discussed in the article?",
        "answer": "The focus of the research is on developing a navigation foundation model (NFMs) that can navigate dynamic urban environments more effectively, by incorporating stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision modules such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why is the use of monocular vision alone ineffective for navigation in dynamic and unstructured settings?",
        "answer": "The use of monocular vision alone is ineffective because it suffers from depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views, which limits accurate spatial reasoning, and it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain."
    },
    {
        "question": "What advantage does the use of stereo inputs provide in the proposed model StereoWalker?",
        "answer": "The use of stereo inputs in StereoWalker resolves the depth-scale ambiguity, which is crucial for precise geometric and dynamic understanding in dynamic and unstructured settings."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does the performance of StereoWalker compare to the state-of-the-art in the field?",
        "answer": "StereoWalker achieves a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the significance of the large stereo navigation dataset curated in this research?",
        "answer": "The large stereo navigation dataset curated in this research is significant because it supports the training of StereoWalker and facilitates future research in the field."
